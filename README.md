#Add2Inbox V0.1

_Works on Android 4.0+_


Add2Inbox is a super simple way to redirect content from Intent.ACTION_SEND intents to user emails. Configuration is simple and straightforward, and only requires the user to accept the permission request from Android’s AccountManager.**


#**Setup**
Import the project into Eclipse, download and place all neccessary libraries, and done. Easy as pie. 


#**Libraries**
Add2Inbox makes use of the JavaMail library, which I didn't include because I'm lazy. You can download the .jars at [the Google Code site](https://code.google.com/p/javamail-android/downloads/list). 

All three must be placed in the “libs” folder for the application to function.
